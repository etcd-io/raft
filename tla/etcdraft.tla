\* A bag of records representing requests and responses sent from one server

    messages
VARIABLE 
    pendingMessages

----
\* The following variables are all per server (functions with domain Server).

\* The server's term number.
VARIABLE 
    \* @type: Int -> Int;
    currentTerm
\* The server's state (Follower, Candidate, or Leader).
VARIABLE 
    \* @type: Int -> Str;
    state
\* The candidate the server voted for in its current term, or
\* Nil if it hasn't voted for any.
VARIABLE 
    \* @type: Int -> Int;
    votedFor
serverVars == <<currentTerm, state, votedFor>>

\* A Sequence of log entries. The index into this sequence is the index of the
\* log entry. Unfortunately, the Sequence module defines Head(s) as the entry
\* with index 1, so be careful not to use that!
VARIABLE 
    \* @type: Int -> [ entries: LOGT, len: Int ];
    log
\* The index of the latest entry in the log the state machine may apply.
VARIABLE 
    \* @type: Int -> Int;
    commitIndex
logVars == <<log, commitIndex>>

\* The following variables are used only on candidates:
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a RequestVote
\* response in its currentTerm.
VARIABLE 
    \* @type: Int -> Set(Int);
    votesResponded
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a vote in its
\* currentTerm.
VARIABLE 
    \* @type: Int -> Set(Int);
    votesGranted
\* @type: Seq(Int -> Set(Int));
candidateVars == <<votesResponded, votesGranted>>

\* The following variables are used only on leaders:
\* The latest entry that each follower has acknowledged is the same as the
\* leader's. This is used to calculate commitIndex on the leader.

VARIABLE

\* 2. Now B and C starts compaign and both become candidates of term 2.
\* 3. B requests vote to A and A grant it. Now A is a term 2 follower whose votedFor is B.
\* 4. A's response to B is lost.
\* 5. C requests vote to B and B grant it. Now B is a term 2 follower whose votedFor is C. 
\* 6. C becomes leader of term 2.
\* 7. C replicates logs to A but not B. 
\* 8. A's votedFor is not changed because the incoming messages has same term (see UpdateTerm and ReturnToFollowerState)

===============================================================================



\* Changelog:
\* 
\* 2023-11-23:
\* - Replace configuration actions by those in etcd implementation.
\* - Refactor spec structure to decouple core spec and model checker spec for 
\*   better readness and future update
\* - Remove unused actions and properties, e.g. wrapper
\*  
\* 2021-04-??:
\* - Abandoned Apalache due to slowness and went back to TLC. There are remains
\*   of the Apalache-specific annotations and message wrapping/unwrapping, but
\*   those are not actually used. The annotations are no longer up-to-date. 
\*
\* 2021-04-09:
\* - Added type annotations for Apalache symbolic model checker. As part of
\*   this change, the message format was changed to a tagged union.
\* 
\* 2016-09-09:
\* - Daniel Ricketts added the major safety invariants and proved them in
\*   TLAPS.
\*
\* 2015-05-10:
\* - Add cluster membership changes as described in Section 4 of
\*     Diego Ongaro. Consensus: Bridging theory and practice.
\*     PhD thesis, Stanford University, 2014.
\*   This introduces: InitServer, ValueEntry, ConfigEntry, CatchupRequest,
\*     CatchupResponse, CheckOldConfig, GetMaxConfigIndex,
\*     GetConfig (parameterized), AddNewServer, DeleteServer,
\*     HandleCatchupRequest, HandleCatchupResponse,
\*     HandleCheckOldConfig 
\*
\* 
\* 2014-12-02:
\* - Fix AppendEntries to only send one entry at a time, as originally
\*   intended. Since SubSeq is inclusive, the upper bound of the range should
\*   have been nextIndex, not nextIndex + 1. Thanks to Igor Kovalenko for
\*   reporting the issue.
\* - Change matchIndex' to matchIndex (without the apostrophe) in
\*   AdvanceCommitIndex. This apostrophe was not intentional and perhaps
\*   confusing, though it makes no practical difference (matchIndex' equals
\*   matchIndex). Thanks to Hugues Evrard for reporting the issue.
\*
\* 2014-07-06:
\* - Version from PhD dissertation
